                 <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
                  I value your trust in providing us your
                  Sensitive Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                  acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                  of transmission over the internet is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                  guarantee its absolute security.

                  I discover that a child under 13 has provided

                  delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                  and you are aware that your child has provided us with
